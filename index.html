            <p>
              Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed
              to making science accessible to all! Over the course of human
              history, science has developed from our early understanding of
              fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies
              far away to the very building blocks of life itself. The aim of
              our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the
              wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
              passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. We
              believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
              brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
              different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
              explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
              with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
              dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night when
              everyone's gone home).

            <p>
              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there's plenty to see and do. You can learn
              about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
              back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits
              are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure
              you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars
              club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00
              where you'll get to explore and experiment with our team of
              experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs
              where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
              discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find
              out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a
              message.

            <h2>For teachers</h2>
            <p>
              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team is on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them. We understand that students learn
              best when they can see, touch, and interact with the subjects
              they're studying. Our guided tours are tailored to enhance their
              understanding, while our state-of-the-art learning laboratory
              offers a space for hands-on experimentation and exploration.
              Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
              facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
              for a visit.
