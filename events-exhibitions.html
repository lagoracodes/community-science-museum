              Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as
              you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your
              own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the
              wonders of science.

            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a
              series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
              power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
              powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are
              able to use and control wind to create power.
