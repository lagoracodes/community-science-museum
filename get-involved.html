                There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are

              <p>
                A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
                displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
                scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
                monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
                discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
                contact us if you'd like to find out more about how you can get
                involved.

                Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship
                at the museum. You'll be learning from a number of different
                academics and people who are passionate about science and
                sharing it with the wider community.
