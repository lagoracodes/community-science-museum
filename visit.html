          <h1>For teachers</h1>
          <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring. Our
            team is on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and
            provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire them.
            We understand that students learn best when they can see, touch, and interact with the subjects they're
            studying. Our guided tours are tailored to enhance their understanding, while our state-of-the-art learning
            laboratory offers a space for hands-on experimentation and exploration.
            Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your
            students through for a visit.
