            <h2>Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The
              Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know
              about the universe around us. We'll locate the various
              constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
              the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
              journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
              Galileo's telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
              our solar system. At our museum, 'The Sky Above Us' is not just an
              exhibition; it's a journey through time and space that inspires
              wonder and curiosity. We invite you to join us in this cosmic
              adventure and experience the thrill of discovery that has captured
              the imagination of generations.

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved in our time. You can also take some time
              to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our
              Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs.

            <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
            <p>
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology offer us unique insights into the great wonders of the
              tiny world. For many people, their life expectancy is much longer
              and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of
              our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits, we
              explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
              breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
              heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have
              come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
              wild. Often our fellow creatures have beaten us to it.

            <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
            <p>
              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
              intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
              applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
              here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
              As we continue to explore the vast potential of AI and robotics,
              we invite you to be a part of this transformative journey. The
              information revolution is not just on the horizon; it's here, and
              our museum is your gateway to understanding, interacting with, and
              celebrating the science of the future.

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p>
              As we learn more and more about the impact humans are having on
              the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore
              how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the
              dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of
              species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we
              can all contribute to a brighter future. As you explore our
              ecology section, you'll not only come to appreciate the intricate
              beauty of our planet but also discover how individual and
              collective efforts can make a real difference. Together, we can
              forge a path towards a more sustainable and harmonious future for
              both humanity and the diverse life forms with which we share this
              precious planet.
